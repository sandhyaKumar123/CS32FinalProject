# CS32FinalProject
Final Project for CS32 for Sandhya Kumar and Gabi Poniz

We want to try and generate a multiplayer hangman game. Ideally, we would like to have a single-player and two-player option. For the single-player option, we want our code to choose a word from a dictionary, potentially not hardcoded but from an external source, and for the multiplayer option one player has a choice to enter a word and the other guesses what the word is. Ideally, we would like some sort of visual display of a typical hangman game, ie. drawing the head, arm, legs, and body of a person.

Scripts:

FPSingle: A single-player Hangman game.

FPClient: A multiplayer Hangman game, where this player is the one guessing letters.

FPServer: A multiplayer Hangman game, where this player is the one choosing the word.

PlayHangman: A script to setup single player or multiplayer game options. For multiplayer
you would need to run the client or server as specified in a seperate window.

Images is a folder of the visual output. We would like to try and make this a GUI that updates. This seems difficult on GitHub though!
